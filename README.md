# 🚗💤 Driver Drowsiness Detection System

# 🚀 Overview

This project implements a real-time driver drowsiness detection system using OpenCV, Python, and deep learning techniques. It continuously monitors facial landmarks, calculates the Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR), and alerts the driver in case of drowsiness, enhancing road safety.

# ✨ Features

✅ Real-time drowsiness detection using a webcam 📹  

✅ EAR calculation to monitor eye closure 👀  

✅ Facial landmark detection for accurate assessment 🧑‍💻  

✅ Alerts when drowsiness is detected 🔔  

✅ Scalable and customizable for future enhancements 🔄

# 🛠️ Technologies Used

  Programming Language: 🐍 Python
      
  Libraries: OpenCV, dlib, imutils, NumPy

  Deep Learning: Keras (Optional for advanced detection models)
# 🧠 How It Works

🟢 Captures video frames from the webcam.  

🟢 Detects facial landmarks and extracts eye coordinates.

🟢 Calculates the Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR) to determine eye closure.

🟢 Triggers an alert if EAR falls below the threshold for a certain period.

# 🎯 Usage

🎥 Run the script and position your face in front of the webcam.

🔍 The system will analyze your eye movements. 

🚨 If drowsiness is detected, you will receive an alert to stay awake!

# 🔮 Future Enhancements

🔹 Implement a deep learning model for higher accuracy.

🔹 Add yawning detection as an additional feature.

🔹 Deploy the system on Raspberry Pi for in-vehicle usage.
